## Features

- Supports addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), division (`/`), and modulo (`%`)
- Backspace and clear functionality
- Clean and responsive UI

## How It Works

- You click buttons to input values.
- The expression is shown in a read-only input field.
- When you press `=`, the `calculate()` function parses and evaluates the expression.
- Follows operator precedence: multiplication/division/modulo first, then addition/subtraction.

## Example Expression

```text
Input:   12 + 7 * 3
Output:  33
```
